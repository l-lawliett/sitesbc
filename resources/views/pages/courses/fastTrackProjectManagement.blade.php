                <h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This Fast Track Project Management&nbsp;course is aligned with the Project Management Institute's (PMIÂ®) Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOKÂ® Guide). It will help you understand and pull together all the knowledge areas and processes of project management necessary to plan and execute, control and close successful projects.</p>
<p>This program includes a Project Management ProfessionalÂ® (PMPÂ®) Prep component to prepare you to take your PMPÂ® certification. A case study is threaded throughout the program, and includes activities (development of many of the planning deliverables and more), which enable participants to apply the lessons learned in the units to the projects they are currently on.</p>
<p>The curriculum is presented in a dual fashion; the theory of PMIÂ® is balanced by the realit of the course instructor's project management experiences. The dual approach provides the student learner with real examples of the theory of PMIÂ®. There are numerous discussion topics throughout, along with exercises to reinforce what participants have learned in the classroom, which translates into opportunities for incorporation of improved practices into your current projects.</p>
<p>Quizzes, also called knowledge checks are given after each module to measure the participant's progress. Additionally, a 100-question practice PMPÂ® certification exam is included. Upon successful completion of this course, you will be granted the 35 PDUs that are required before taking the PMPÂ® certification exam.</p>
